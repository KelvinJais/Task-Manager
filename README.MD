# Task Manager Project

The project is created by following the youtube tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oe421EPjeBE by John Smilga. This project has allowed me to be familiar with creating a web app using NodeJS, ExpressJS and using MongoDB. I was also able to learn using tools like Postman for debugging and checking API calls.

## Project Setup

In order to run the project, setup .env and set MONGO_URI variable equal to DB connection string.
run " npm install " to install all the required files
run " npm start " to run the website on your localhost
